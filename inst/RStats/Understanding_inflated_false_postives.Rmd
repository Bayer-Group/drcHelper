# Understanding False Positives in RCBD Designs: A Mathematical Decomposition

During the simulation study, due to my labeling of  high false positive rates in a Randomized Complete Block Design (RCBD) with positional effects.

## The Experimental Setup

- 5 treatment groups (doses)
- Each treatment has tanks numbered 1-3
- All tank #1s are in Position 1, all tank #2s in Position 2, etc.
- True response is identical across all treatments (no treatment effect)

## Mathematical Decomposition

### True Data Generating Process

For an observation from dose i, tank/block j:

$$Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + \beta_j + \epsilon_{ij}$$

Where:

- $\mu$ is the overall mean (100 in your case)
- $\alpha_i$ is the treatment effect (0 for all treatments in your simulation)
- $\beta_j$ is the block/Position effect (random, with variance $\sigma^2_{\text{block}}$)
- $\epsilon_{ij}$ is the residual error (random, with variance $\sigma^2_{\text{error}}$)

### Variance Components

The total variance in the data is:

$$\text{Var}(Y_{ij}) = \text{Var}(\alpha_i) + \text{Var}(\beta_j) + \text{Var}(\epsilon_{ij})$$

In your simulation:
- $\text{Var}(\alpha_i) = 0$ (no true treatment effect)
- $\text{Var}(\beta_j) = \sigma^2_{\text{block}}$ (block/Position variance)
- $\text{Var}(\epsilon_{ij}) = \sigma^2_{\text{error}}$ (residual variance)

## The Statistical Model

When you fit `Response ~ Dose + (1|Tank)`, you're using the model:

$$Y_{ij} = \mu + \alpha_i + b_j + e_{ij}$$

Where:
- $b_j \sim N(0, \sigma^2_{\text{tank}})$ is the random tank effect
- $e_{ij} \sim N(0, \sigma^2_e)$ is the residual error

## Why False Positives Occur

### 1. F-test for Treatment Effect

The F-test for treatment effect is:

$$F = \frac{\text{MS}_{\text{treatment}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{error}}}$$

Where:

- $\text{MS}_{\text{treatment}}$ is the mean square for treatments
- $\text{MS}_{\text{error}}$ is the mean square error

### 2. Expected Mean Squares

In a RCBD, the expected mean squares are:

$$E(\text{MS}_{\text{treatment}}) = \sigma^2_{\text{error}} + n \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{treatment}}$$
$$E(\text{MS}_{\text{block}}) = \sigma^2_{\text{error}} + k \cdot \sigma^2_{\text{block}}$$
$$E(\text{MS}_{\text{error}}) = \sigma^2_{\text{error}}$$

Where:

- $n$ is the number of blocks
- $k$ is the number of treatments

### 3. The Critical Issue: Denominator for F-test

In a proper RCBD analysis, the F-test for treatment should use:

$$F = \frac{\text{MS}_{\text{treatment}}}{\text{MS}_{\text{error}}}$$

But the error term $\text{MS}_{\text{error}}$ is only appropriate if the block√ótreatment interaction is negligible.

### 4. Variance Inflation Due to Block Structure

When all tank #1s are in Position 1, etc., you create a systematic structure where:

$$\text{Var}(\bar{Y}_{i.} - \bar{Y}_{i'.}) < \frac{2\sigma^2_{\text{error}}}{n}$$

This is because the block effects partially cancel out when comparing treatment means, making treatments appear more different than they really are.

## Mathematical Proof of Inflated Type I Error

For a standard F-test with no treatment effect, the test statistic follows an F-distribution with (k-1) and (n-1)(k-1) degrees of freedom.

However, with your block structure, the actual distribution has a higher mean than expected under the null hypothesis:

$$E(F) > 1$$

This shifts the entire distribution to the right, causing more frequent rejections of the null hypothesis.

## Numerical Example

With 5 treatments, 3 blocks, and assuming:
- $\sigma^2_{\text{block}} = 4$ (block variance)
- $\sigma^2_{\text{error}} = 1$ (residual variance)

The expected F-statistic under the null hypothesis should be 1, but with your design it becomes approximately:

$$E(F) \approx 1 + \frac{\sigma^2_{\text{block}} \cdot \text{ICC}}{(k-1)\sigma^2_{\text{error}}}$$

Where ICC is the intraclass correlation coefficient.

This explains why you're seeing false positive rates of 20-40% instead of the expected 5%.

## Solution

The correct model for your design is:

$$\text{Response} \sim \text{Dose} + \text{Block} + \text{Dose:Block}$$

Or in R:
```r
lmer(Response ~ Dose + (1|Block) + (1|Dose:Block))
```

This properly accounts for the block structure and will bring your false positive rate back to the expected 5%.
