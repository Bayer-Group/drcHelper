# Dunnett Test Validation Summary

## Files Created

### Documentation & Analysis
- **`Data_Quality_Issues_Report.md`** - Comprehensive report for test data provider
- **`test_cases_res_corrected.rda`** - Fixed reference data with invalid placeholders replaced

### Validation Reports
1. **`Dunnett_Test_Cases_Original_Data_Issues.html`** 
   - Shows validation failures with original problematic data
   - Documents all data quality issues for provider communication
   - **Keep as evidence of data problems**

2. **`Dunnett_Test_Cases_With_Corrections.html`**
   - Uses corrected reference data (invalid placeholders → NA)
   - Shows improved validation results after basic fixes
   - Demonstrates what validation looks like with cleaner data

## Data Issues Identified & Actions Taken

### ✅ **Successfully Fixed:**
1. **Invalid Placeholders (605 rows):**
   - **Problem:** `"-"` and empty string placeholders in expected results
   - **Fix:** Replaced with proper `NA` values
   - **Impact:** Prevents validation crashes, allows proper statistical comparisons

### ⚠️ **Partially Addressable (Requires Provider Action):**
2. **Dose-Mean Misalignment:**
   - **Problem:** Expected means appear rotated/shifted relative to actual dose assignments
   - **Example:** Dose 0.1 expected = 27.94, actual = 62.44 (34.5 difference!)
   - **Status:** **Cannot fix programmatically** - requires provider verification

3. **Missing Expected Values:**
   - **Problem:** Some doses have `NA` in expected T-statistics after fixing placeholders
   - **Status:** **Cannot generate** - requires provider calculations

## Validation Results Impact

### Before Corrections:
- Multiple crashes due to invalid `"-"` placeholders
- Unable to perform meaningful statistical comparisons
- Framework appeared broken

### After Basic Corrections:
- Validation runs successfully without crashes
- Can identify genuine statistical differences vs data errors
- Framework demonstrates it works correctly with clean data
- Remaining failures are legitimate data quality issues

## Communication to Test Data Provider

**Subject:** Critical Data Quality Issues in Dunnett Test Reference Data

**Key Points:**
1. **605 invalid placeholder values** need to be replaced with proper numeric values or NA
2. **Dose-mean misalignment** suggests systematic data entry errors in MOCK08/15-001 study  
3. **Missing expected T-statistics** for several dose levels need to be calculated
4. **Data integrity process** should be implemented to prevent similar issues

**Evidence Provided:**
- Detailed analysis in `Data_Quality_Issues_Report.md`
- Before/after validation reports showing impact
- Specific examples of misaligned data

## Final Answer to Your Question

**Can I fix the data issues to make validation pass?**

**Partial YES:**
- ✅ Fixed 605 invalid placeholders (critical infrastructure issue)
- ✅ Created working validation framework that handles clean data correctly
- ✅ Demonstrated validation would work with proper reference data

**NO for remaining issues:**
- ❌ Cannot fix dose-mean misalignment (requires domain knowledge)
- ❌ Cannot generate missing expected T-statistics (requires statistical calculations)  
- ❌ Cannot verify which expected values are correct (requires independent validation)

**Recommendation:** Use the corrected validation report to show the provider exactly what needs to be fixed. The framework is working correctly - the remaining issues are genuine data quality problems that require provider attention.
