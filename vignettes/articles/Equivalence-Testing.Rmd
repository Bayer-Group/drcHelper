## Introduction

The null and alternative hypotheses in equivalence tests are

$$
H_0
$$
 

## An example using chick weights dataset

```{r}
library(equivUMP)
```

```{r}
  # compare two feed from chickwts dataset
  data("chickwts")
  chickwts2 <- chickwts[chickwts$feed %in% c("linseed", "soybean"),]
  chickwts2$feed <- droplevels(chickwts2$feed)

  # similar but cannot be shown to be equivalent up to 0.5 sigma at 0.05 level^
  plot(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts2)
  equiv.test(weight ~ feed, data = chickwts2, eps = 0.5)
```
