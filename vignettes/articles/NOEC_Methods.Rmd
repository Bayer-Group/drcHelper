## Dunnet Tests

Dunnett's test is a multiple comparison test for determining significant differences between the mean values of several test groups and a control with normally distributed errors with homogeneous variance. Dunnett's test is robust to slight violations of the normality and variance homogeneity assumptions.

There are several packages providing function for the calculation of the Dunnett’s test. The function "DunnettTest` from the library `DescTools` is calculating correct results for the "two.sided" direction. The function `dunnettTest` from the library `PMCMRplus` can be used to calculate the test options “less” (smaller), “greater” and "two.sided". The results for the "two.sided" option differ in some cases from the results of `DunnettTest` from the library “DescTools`. The function
