For a particular endpoint, analysis should follow the recommended flowchart in OECD 54 or in specific test guidelines. Deviations from a standard procedure should be justified.

## Example Routine Analysis Flowcharts

Typical flowcharts for derving NOECs and ECx are shown in @fig-NOEC-Monotonic , @fig-NOEC-nonMonotonic and @fig-ECx-Monotonic . For dose response with hormesis effects or highly erratic, it should be consulted with at statistician.

In this vignette, we are going to use dataset oecd201 as an example.

## Data overview


## Assumptions check

Pretests or checks could be conducted before testing, however, assumptions could also be checked after modelling, using a more holistic approach. Here we follow the routine procedure. 

> To allow the choice of the appropriate statistical tests, the normality and homoscedasticity (variance homogeneity) of a certain endpoint (e.g., shoot dry weight) data were checked.



### Check for normality


## NOER determination


## ER and ER determination 



## An overview of the endpoints

```{r}

```


The NOER, LOER, ER25 and ER50 for survival, plant height and shoot dry weight expressed as g a.s./ha
are summarized for each of the plant species for the final assessment (21 days after application) and can
be found in the following tables.
