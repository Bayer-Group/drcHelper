## Purpose of Testing

The testing in this phase is to ensure the R package meets all user requirements (URS) and behaves as the end users expect. If any of the tests fail, it is possible to detect loopholes and fix errors early in development. 

Note that access security and scalability are taken care of by the V-COP environment. The purpose of this testing is limited to all functional requirements. Interfacing ability via API with V-COP file management and  the validated run environment is designed to be tested manually.
