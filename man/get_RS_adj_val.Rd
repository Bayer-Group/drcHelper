\title{Calculate Rao-Scott Adjusted Values for Clustered Binary Data}
\usage{
get_RS_adj_val(group, replicate, affected, total)
}
\arguments{
\item{group}{Vector of treatment group identifiers}

\item{replicate}{Vector of replicate/tank identifiers within treatment groups}

\item{affected}{Vector of counts of affected subjects (fish with injuries) in each replicate}

\item{total}{Vector of total subjects (fish) in each replicate}
}
\value{
A tibble containing the following columns:
\item{grp}{Treatment group identifier}
\item{x}{Total number of affected subjects in the treatment group}
\item{n}{Total number of subjects in the treatment group}
\item{m}{Number of replicates in the treatment group}
\item{p_hat}{Estimated proportion of affected subjects in the treatment group}
\item{b}{Binomial variance of p_hat}
\item{v}{Estimated variance accounting for clustering}
\item{D}{Design effect (ratio of cluster-adjusted variance to binomial variance)}
\item{n_tilde}{Adjusted sample size accounting for clustering}
\item{x_tilde}{Adjusted number of affected subjects accounting for clustering}
}
\description{
This function calculates the Rao-Scott adjustment for clustered binary data
to account for intra-cluster correlation when analyzing dose-response relationships.
}
\details{
The function first aggregates data by treatment group to calculate overall proportions.
It then computes the variance within each treatment group accounting for clustering,
and calculates a design effect (D) as the ratio of cluster-adjusted variance to
binomial variance. The sample size and affected counts are then adjusted by
dividing by this design effect.
