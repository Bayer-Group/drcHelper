\description{
The function is adapted from the archived version of StatCharrms developed by
Joe Swintek et al with CC0 license. It is not updated anymore and included
for validation purpose. There are other ways to perform a trend test.
This function tests whether a dose-response relationship follows a monotonic
trend (consistently increasing or decreasing) by analyzing both linear and
quadratic components of the relationship.
}
\details{
The test first applies a rank transformation to the response variable using
the rankTransform function, which implements Blom's method (equivalent to
SAS PROC RANK with NORMAL=BLOM). Next it creates linear and quadratic
contrasts using the getLineContrast and getQuadContrast functions. Then it
fits an ANOVA model using the transformed response variable and extracts
the summary statistics from the ANOVA model.

Interpretations:
If only the linear component is significant: Strong evidence for monotonicity.
If both linear and quadratic components are significant: The relationship is
monotonic but with curvature. If only the quadratic component is significant:
The relationship is likely non-monotonic (e.g., U-shaped). If neither
component is significant: No clear dose-response relationship detected

Note that contrasts<- need to be imported from stats.This is a function
that is used to set contrasts on factors.
