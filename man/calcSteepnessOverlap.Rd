\usage{
calcSteepnessOverlap(
  mod = NULL,
  obj = NULL,
  trend = "Decrease",
  CI = "inv",
  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mod}{fitted object from drm model fitting}

\item{obj}{Calculated ED 10, 20, 50 object if available.
mod should set to be NULL in this case}

\item{trend}{"Decrease" or "Increase"}

\item{CI}{method to calculate CI, either "inv" (bmd) or "delta" or "fls".}

\item{...}{other parameters that will be passed into ED.plus}
}

a table with certainty of potection level and steepness of the models
}
