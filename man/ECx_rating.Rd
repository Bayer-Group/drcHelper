\title{Rate Effect Concentration Estimates Based on Normalized Width}
\usage{
ECx_rating(x)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector of normalized width values to be rated}
}
\value{
Character vector of ratings with the following categories:
\itemize{
\item "Excellent" for NW < 0.2
\item "Good" for 0.2 <= NW < 0.5
\item "Fair" for 0.5 <= NW < 1
\item "Poor" for 1 <= NW < 2
\item "Bad" for NW >= 2
\item "Not defined" for NA or NaN values
}
}
\description{
Assigns qualitative ratings to normalized width values of confidence intervals
based on predefined thresholds.
}
\examples{
# Basic examples
ECx_rating(c(0.1, 0.3, 0.7, 1.5, 2.5, NA))

# Example with typical normalized widths
nw_values <- c(0.15, 0.45, 0.95, 1.8, 2.5)
ECx_rating(nw_values)
}
